# NumPadDeck
A lightweight, high-performance Stream Deck emulator for AutoHotkey v2. This script transforms your standard Numpad into a powerful, multi-profile macro pad with a sleek OSD (On-Screen Display) interface.

AHK Numpad Deck
"Turn your boring Numpad into a powerful Command Center"
Numpad Deck is a lightweight engine that transforms your keyboard's numeric keypad into a fully customizable macro pad — similar to an Elgato Stream Deck, but without the $150 price tag.

Whether you're a gamer who needs extra keys for skills, a video editor looking for shortcuts, or a coder who wants to automate repetitive tasks, this script gives you unlimited power using the keys you already have.

 Why you'll love it:
One Key, Many Worlds: Switch between different "Profiles" (Gaming, Work, System) with one click.

Modern Interface: A sleek, minimal HUD (OSD) shows you which profile is active. No more guessing.
Smart & Fast: It works even if your NumLock is ON or OFF. It's built on AutoHotkey v2 for maximum speed and zero lag.
No Extra Hardware: Uses the numpad you already have on your desk.

 How it works:
Toggle Mode: Press NumLock to enter "Deck Mode". Your numpad now runs your macros.
Switch Profiles: Use / and * to flip through your custom setups (e.g., from "Discord/Music" to "Hardcore Gaming").
Customize: Just open the script and tell it what you want each button to do. It’s that simple.
